# Interactive Infographic Android app
In this project, our team was tasked with creating an Android tablet application that displayed a single interactive infographic from (a small portion of!!!) data that could be retrieved from the World Bank data set.
# Requirements
The infographic must visualise data retrieved from the World Bank data set. As a visualisation, it should be able to expose patterns or provide insights that a mere table or simple chart does not. Most importantly, the infographic must not be misleading! To ensure this, some background research into the pitfalls of data visualisation is needed.

The infographic should be usable on a range of Android tablets, but not on other types of devices such as phones, wearable devices and TVs. It should be possible to interact with the infographic to explore the data, e.g. by setting certain parameters. There may also be certain animated elements in the infographic, provided they do not detract from the information being displayed.

The infographic should informative to a particular group of users. The team should take care to understand the target user and their information needs. The team should be able to support its claims about the target user with evidence.

Your app can be enhanced in a number of other ways:

Data caching: It would be good to store the data used to generate the infographic on the device so that the application can be used while there is no internet connection.
Scaling to different screen sizes and pixel densities: As stated above, the app should be usable on a range of Android devices. Polished GUI: Focus your efforts on producing a polished user interface rather than lots of features. There are certain features your application does not need to implement:

Additional screens: There is no need for any additional screens with information, such as help text, an "about" screen, a splash screen, etc. A single infographic is all that the app needs to display. Multiple visualisations: The app only needs to produce one infographic. The infographic may display only subsets of data at any one time and enable the user to adjust these through interaction. However, the app should focus on producing one good infographic rather than a selection of mediocre ones.
